# Getting Started

## How do I access to AWS solutions via Harvard?

These are the main routes:

1. [**URC managed environments**](https://rc.harvard.edu/services/) the Harvard University Research Computing group (URC) manages clusters that are supported by AWS in the back. 

    Harvard research groups can request access to these AWS environments if they have one of the following needs:

    a [**Regulated Data (ReD) Environment**](https://rc.harvard.edu/services/#regulated-data) – for performing research on level 6 or highly confidential data

    b [**Central GPU cluster**](https://rc.harvard.edu/services/#central-gpu) – for research requiring GPU compute or large CPU nodes.

2. [**Harvard AWS account**](https://seas.harvard.edu/office-computing/web-services/add-cloud-account-harvard-cloud-program) Harvard IT (HUIT) provides access to the "Harvard AWS Console," for which you must have a Harvard affiliation and use Harvard's Cloud Account Provisioning portal.

    c **AWS console** For utilizing AWS native tools (Sage Maker, AWS Nextflow, etc)

## How do I decide which AWS compute resources to use?

Deciding which AWS cloud resources to use depends on your research needs. Unknowingly, you might already be using AWS cloud resources through Harvard based environments (a or b above). Else we could assess if there is an AWS solution that is well suited for your research and is accessible through the portal (option c) .
