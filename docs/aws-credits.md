# AWS Credits

## How do I access my awarded credits?

For awarded credits to be applied, you will require a compute plan. But do not worry! To remove the burden on the researchers, the HDSI Data Scientists will be helping put together the plan for you. 

To get started, reach out to michelle_audirac@harvard.edu:

1. An initial amount of credits will be applied.
2. The HDSI Data Scientists will setup a meeting to understand your workflow and needs. 
3. A compute plan will be prepared and shared for your review. 
4. Credits will be applied as your project progresses.

 5. Credits Applied as You Progress
   → Credits loaded in stages tied to project milestones

```

>Tip: The compute plan is a living document — it grows with your project.
You focus on research; we handle the scaling.

## Can I get credits applied immediately upon request?
Yes, once the first compute plan has been put together, you can put a request when you run out of credits. If your needs or progress shift, we’ll adjust your compute plan to keep your work moving, reach out to the HDSI Data Scientists.
