# Welcome to HDSI AWS Impact Computing

Let's create applications-centered compute solutions for social impact.

## 1. Data Infrastructure

Identify the computing and storage backbone that supports your research.

## 2. Data Pipelines & Processing

Automated workflows for ingesting, cleaning, transforming, and harmonizing data from multiple sources.

Modular and reproducible.

## 3. Data Standards & Metadata

Consistent naming, units, and documentation so data is discoverable and reusable.

Think of schema definitions, metadata registries, or FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.

## 4. Analytical & Machine Learning Layers

Refactoring code and setup jobs to run your models: predictive models, simulations, or foundation models.

This layer can include APIs for inference.

## 5. Access, Collaboration, and Reuse

The interfaces that let others interact with the data or model:

APIs, dashboards, data catalogs, or repositories.

Making your artifacts open.
